1. Explain the lifecycle of an Android activity.

    Answer: The Android activity lifecycle includes several stages: onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onRestart(), and onDestroy().
    These methods handle transitions between activity states.

2. What is the difference between an implicit and explicit intent?

      Answer: Explicit intents specify the exact activity to start by class name, whereas implicit intents declare a general action to perform, 
      allowing the system to find the appropriate component.

3. What is the purpose of the ViewModel class in Android Architecture Components?

   Answer: ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
   It allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations, helping to avoid common issues like memory leaks and crashes.
